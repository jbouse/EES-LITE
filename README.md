Ham Radio Emergency Email Server Lite for Raspberry Pi

Once installed, this code will allow anyone with a wireless device to connect to your raspberry pi and compose an email. Once composed, the email will be moved to your Pat Winlink Outbox where it can be reviewed before being sent over RF using either packet or ARDOP. If you choose to allow replies back into the system, you will be able to post those replies to a webpage where the end user can search/view their replies.
